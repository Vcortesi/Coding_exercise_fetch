## My Experience

This coding exercise provided me with a great learning opportunity to work with Kotlin and Android Studio.
As someone new to Kotlin, I found the language to be expressive and concise, making it enjoyable to work with.

One of the main goals of this exercise was to gain experience in writing unit tests.
I used JUnit and Mockito to write comprehensive tests for the ViewModel and the API integration.
Through this process, I learned how to write testable code, create mock objects, and verify the behavior of my app in different scenarios.
It was a valuable experience that improved my confidence in writing reliable and testable code.

Overall, this project helped me deepen my understanding of Kotlin, Android development, and software testing.
